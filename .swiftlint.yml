  - empty_collection_literal # Prefer checking isEmpty over comparing to an empty collection.
  - empty_count # Prefer checking isEmpty over comparing count to zero.
  - empty_string # Prefer checking isEmpty over comparing string to an empty string literal.
  - expiring_todo # TODOs and FIXMEs should be resolved prior to their expiry date.
  - overridden_super_call # Some overridden methods should always call super
  - toggle_bool # Prefer someBool.toggle() over someBool = !someBool.
  - unused_declaration # Declarations should be referenced at least once within all files linted.
  - unused_import # All imported modules should be required to make the file compile.
  - vertical_parameter_alignment # Function parameters should be aligned vertically if they’re in multiple lines in a declaration.
  - vertical_parameter_alignment_on_call # Function parameters should be aligned vertically if they’re in multiple lines in a method call.
  - vertical_whitespace_closing_braces # Don’t include (empty line) before closing braces.
